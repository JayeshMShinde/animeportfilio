   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing Colors

The color scheme is defined using CSS variables at the top of the `<style>` section:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #00FFFF;
    --secondary-color: #FF00FF;
    --accent-color: #FFD700;
    --background-color: #1A1A2E;

}
```

Modify these values to change the overall color scheme of the portfolio.

### Adding Projects

```html
<div class="project">
    <h3>Your Project Name</h3>
    <p>Brief description of your project.</p>
</div>
```

### Changing the Anime Character

Replace the `images/itachi.png` file with your preferred character image. Make sure to keep the same file name or update it in the CSS:

```css
#anime-coder {
